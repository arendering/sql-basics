-- UNION

Все SELECT запросы должны возвращать одинаковое кол-во столбцов:

  SELECT DATE_FORMAT(date, "%d.%m.%y") as date, amount, 'bank' as payment_type 
    FROM bank_transactions WHERE client_id = 56
  UNION
  SELECT DATE_FORMAT(date, "%d.%m.%y"), amount, 'cash'
    FROM cashbox_transactions WHERE client_id = 56;

Оборачиваем в скобки SELECT, если хотим сортировать итоговую выборку:

  (SELECT date, amount, 'cash' AS pt FROM cashbox_transactions)
  UNION
  (SELECT date, amount, 'paypal' AS pt FROM paypal_transactions)
  ORDER BY date DESC;

Группировка:

  SELECT year, month, SUM(amount) AS month_amount 
  FROM (
    SELECT year(date) AS year, month(date) AS month, amount FROM bank_transactions
    UNION
    SELECT year(date) AS year, month(date) AS month, amount FROM cashbox_transactions
    UNION
    SELECT year(date) AS year, month(date) AS month, amount FROM paypal_transactions) t
  GROUP BY year, month
  ORDER BY year, month
